# Rfid-based-smart-door-lock
In modern security systems, RFID-based access control plays a crucial role in enhancing convenience and security. This project focuses on developing an RFID-based smart door lock system using an Arduino Uno to grant access only to authorized users. 
The system utilizes an RFID reader (MFRC522) to scan RFID cards and verify access credentials.The primary goal is to create a secure and cost-effective electronic lock system that replaces traditional key-based mechanisms.
A relay module controls a solenoid lock, allowing automatic door unlocking for authorized users. The system provides real-time feedback using LED indicators and a buzzer, ensuring intuitive user interaction.
